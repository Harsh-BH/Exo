You are an expert SaaS technical writer and senior software architect.

Your task is to completely refactor and upgrade this repository’s README.md into a professional, SaaS-level, production-ready document.

Instructions:

1. First, deeply analyze the entire repository:
   - Understand the product vision and problem it solves
   - Identify the target audience (developers, users, enterprises, etc.)
   - Inspect the tech stack (frontend, backend, database, infra, AI, blockchain, etc.)
   - Read package.json, requirements.txt, docker files, configs, environment variables
   - Understand architecture patterns and integrations
   - Identify deployment methods
   - Detect missing documentation areas

2. Rewrite the README with a strong SaaS positioning:
   - Clear product headline (value-driven, not technical)
   - One-line powerful pitch
   - Short problem statement
   - Clear solution explanation
   - Key features (benefit-focused, not just feature list)
   - Architecture overview
   - Tech stack breakdown
   - Setup instructions (developer-friendly)
   - Environment variables section
   - Deployment guide
   - API documentation (if applicable)
   - Folder structure explanation
   - Screenshots section placeholder
   - Roadmap section
   - Contribution guidelines
   - License
   - Author section

3. Writing Style Requirements:
   - Clear, crisp, startup-quality language
   - Confident and professional tone
   - Avoid unnecessary verbosity
   - Use structured markdown formatting
   - Use tables where appropriate
   - Add badges (build, license, tech stack)
   - Make it visually clean and scannable
   - Make it investor/demo ready

4. Upgrade positioning:
   - Present it as a scalable product
   - Mention scalability, modularity, security, performance where relevant
   - Emphasize real-world use cases
   - Highlight AI/blockchain/infra advantages if present

5. If something is missing:
   - Infer intelligently from the codebase
   - Add TODO placeholders where assumptions are made
   - Suggest improvements at the end under "Suggested Enhancements"

Output:
- A fully rewritten README.md file
- Proper markdown formatting
- Production-ready quality
- No explanations — only final README content
